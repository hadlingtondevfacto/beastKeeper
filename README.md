This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Summary

This is a very quickly thrown together attempt at React, because it was more fun than doing something in python. //fun spelled s-t-r-e-s-s

To see it work, clone the git repo

git clone https://github.com/hadlingtondevfacto/beastKeeper.git
cd beastKeeper
npm install
npm start

It does nothing. It's basically just a carousel and a dropdown menu as of four hours work. There was some misdirection involved.
